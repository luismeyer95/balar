## ‚ö° Quick Start

```ts
import { balar } from 'balar';

// Suppose we have a remote API for managing a greenhouse that we interact with
// through this service
class GreenhouseService {
  async getPlants(plantIds: number[]): Promise<Map<number, Plant>> { ... }
  async waterPlants(plants: Plant[]): Promise<Map<Plant, Date>> { ... }
}

// Wrap the service object with Balar
const wrapper = balar.wrap.object(new GreenhouseService());

// You can also wrap standalone functions like this
// const wrapper = balar.wrap.fns({ getPlants, waterPlants });

// Let's water multiple plants at once
const plantIds = [1, 2, 3]; // üåø üåµ üå±

// This code reads like plants are being watered in sequence, but...
const results = await balar.run(plantIds, async function waterPlant(plantId) {
  // Balar queues all calls to `wrapper.getPlants(plantId)` and invokes
  // the real `getPlants([1, 2, 3])` exactly once under the hood
  const plant = await wrapper.getPlants(plantId);

  // ... Do other sync/async operations, return error, anything goes ...

  // Similarly, the real `waterPlants([plant, ...])` is called exactly once
  const wateredAt = await wrapper.waterPlants(plant!);

  return { name: plant!.name, wateredAt };
});

// Total number of requests to our remote API: 2! ‚úîÔ∏è

// Map { 1 => { name: "Fern", wateredAt: ... }, 2 => { name: "Cactus", wateredAt: ... }, ... }
console.log(results);
```

## üåÄ Introduction

When it comes to asynchronous bulk processing, Balar gives you the best of both worlds: the simplicity of single-item processing logic with the performance of bulk operations.

Networking is often a bottleneck in modern web applications. Cloud technology has made it easy to scale up processing power, RAM, or storage, but each networking call still needs to negotiate a complicated and unreliable global network of computers, routers, switches, and protocols adding a lot of overhead. Therefore to minimize time spent in code that processes items in bulk, it's usually better to make fewer requests with more data as opposed to making more requests with less data.

However, some simple logic to process one item can become quite complex when scaled to multiple items in a way that batches outbound requests to minimize network calls. You suddenly have to handle "diverging states" at each step of your processing (e.g. some items may pass a validation check, but others may not and should be filtered out for the next step), or need to link outputs to inputs for error handling, etc.

Balar allows you to write asynchronous bulk processing code that <em>looks</em> like it handles one item at a time in complete isolation, but without compromising on the efficiency of outbound asynchronous requests. Effectively, you describe how to handle one item, and Balar ensures that the underlying execution is as efficient as hand-written bulk processing code.

Say you have an API endpoint to allow users to update the budget they can spend on your service. It has some validation checks like below. For the sake of simplicity, we use `string` for errors and `true` for success.

```ts
type Budget = { id: number; amount: number };
type BudgetUpdateRequest = Budget;

class BudgetsRepository {
  async getBudget(id: number): Promise<Budget> { ... }
  async updateBudget(id: BudgetUpdateRequest): Promise<boolean> { ... }
}

const repository = new BudgetsRepository();

async function updateBudgetWithValidation(
  updateBudget: BudgetUpdateRequest,
): Promise<string | true> {
  if (updateBudget.amount === 0) {
    return 'budget should be greater than 0';
  }

  const currentBudget = await repository.getBudget(updateBudget.id);
  if (updateBudget.amount < currentBudget!.amount) {
    return 'budget must not be lowered';
  }

  const success = await repository.updateBudget(updateBudget);
  if (!success) {
    return 'budget update failed';
  }

  return true;
}
```

Now let‚Äôs say your product offering evolved, and users can have multiple budgets to allocate to different services which they will want to update in real-time with low latency. Surely with these requirements, we don‚Äôt want to just run this code for each budget in sequence but instead batch reads and updates to minimize network latency.

Alright, let‚Äôs create a bulk endpoint that can process a list of budget updates.

```ts
type Budget = { id: number; amount: number };
type BudgetUpdateRequest = Budget;

// Notice that we adapted the methods to handle multiple items at once
class BudgetsRepository {
  async getBudgets(id: number[]): Promise<Map<number, Budget>> { ... }
  async updateBudgets(
    requests: BudgetUpdateRequest[],
  ): Promise<Map<BudgetUpdateRequest, boolean>> { ... }
}

const repository = new BudgetsRepository();

async function updateBudgetsWithValidation(
  requests: BudgetUpdateRequest[],
): Promise<Map<Budget, string | true>> {
  const resultByRequest = new Map<BudgetUpdateRequest, string | true>();

  const positiveBudgetUpdateRequests: BudgetUpdateRequest[] = [];
  for (const request of requests) {
    if (request.amount <= 0) {
      resultByRequest.set(request, 'budget should be greater than 0');
    } else {
      positiveBudgetUpdateRequests.push(request);
    }
  }

  const currentBudgets = await repository.getBudgets(
    positiveBudgetUpdateRequests.map((r) => r.id),
  );

  const validBudgetUpdateRequests: BudgetUpdateRequest[] = [];
  for (const request of positiveBudgetUpdateRequests) {
    const currentBudget = currentBudgets.get(request.id)!;
    if (request.amount < currentBudget.amount) {
      resultByRequest.set(request, 'budget must not be lowered');
    } else {
      validBudgetUpdateRequests.push(request);
    }
  }

  const updateResult = await repository.updateBudgets(validBudgetUpdateRequests);

  for (const [request, success] of updateResult) {
    resultByRequest.set(request, success || 'budget update failed');
  }

  return resultByRequest;
}
```

Okay, this works but we definitely see how bulk processing can obscure a bit the original logic. What if you could have the efficiency of bulk processing and the simplicity of single-item (scalar) processing logic? Balar allows you to have both.

```ts
import { balar } from 'balar';

type Budget = { id: number; amount: number };
type BudgetUpdateRequest = Budget;

// Notice that we adapted the methods to handle multiple items at once
class BudgetsRepository {
  async getBudgets(id: number[]): Promise<Map<number, Budget>> { ... }
  async updateBudgets(
    requests: BudgetUpdateRequest[],
  ): Promise<Map<BudgetUpdateRequest, boolean>> { ... }
}

// The repository is wrapped in a Balar object. The Balar object only exposes the
// methods that match the above "bulk signature", adding an overload for each of
// the methods so they can also be called with a single item. Precisely, for every
// `(i: I[]) => Map<I, O>` method in the object, a `(i: I) => O` overload is added.
const repository = balar.wrap.object(new BudgetsRepository());

async function updateBudgetsWithValidation(
  requests: BudgetUpdateRequest[],
): Promise<Map<BudgetUpdateRequest, string | true>> {
  return balar.run(requests, async (request) => {
    if (request.amount === 0) {
      return 'budget should be greater than 0';
    }

    const currentBudget = await repository.getBudgets(request.id);
    if (request.amount < currentBudget!.amount) {
      return 'budget must not be lowered';
    }

    const success = await repository.updateBudgets(request);
    if (!success) {
      return 'budget update failed';
    }

    return true;
  });
}
```

This code is equivalent to the previous example doing manual batching. It may look like it runs 2 network calls per request, but it only runs 2 network calls in total regardless of the number of requests.

Essentially, Balar provides a clean scalar-like API to queue inputs to bulk functions of your choice and execute them in one batch. No manual batching, no managing parallel states; just clean, focused scalar logic with bulk efficiency!

</details>

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

The Balar executor calls the processor function provided to `balar.run()` for each input immediately, then tracks and controls the progress of each call. The concurrent execution of these calls is divided into steps, each new step being the result of a ‚Äúcheckpoint event‚Äù.

Whenever any given execution of the processor function hits a call to a Balar function, it forwards some input(s) to execute within a bulk operation and registers itself as ‚Äúawaiting a checkpoint‚Äù. This particular execution is on hold until the checkpoint resolves, and this checkpoint resolves once all the other executions have either:

- Called a Balar function themselves
- Or returned from the processor function

Once this happens, Balar executes all bulk operations that were buffered during this step using the inputs gathered from all executions. Results are then dispatched to the processor function executions, who then continue to progress towards the next checkpoint until all executions have returned.

In short, the processor function is executed concurrently for all inputs, but with added synchronization checkpoints at Balar function call sites to allow accumulating multiple actions/queries into single bulk operations. See the budget update example annotated with checkpoint information below.

```ts 
const requests = [
  { id: 1, amount: 1000 }, // success (from 500 to 1000)
  { id: 2, amount: 0 },    // fail: can't have 0
  { id: 3, amount: 1 },    // fail: can't lower (from 1500 to 1)
  { id: 4, amount: 3000 }, // fail (arbitrary update failure)
];

await balar.run(requests, async (request) => {
  if (request.amount === 0) {
    return 'budget should be greater than 0';              // ]-- #2 returns 
  }                                                        //              |
                                                           //              |
  const currentBudget = await repo.getBudgets(request.id); // ]-- getBudgets([1,3,4])
  if (request.amount < currentBudget!.amount) {
    return 'budget must not be lowered';                   // ]-- #3 returns
  }                                                        //              |
                                                           //              |
  const success = await repo.updateBudgets(request);       // ]-- updateBudgets([1,4])
  if (!success) {
    return 'budget update failed';                         // ]-- #4 returns
  }                                                        //              |
                                                           //              |
  return true;                                             // ]-- #1 returns
});

```

## ‚ùì FAQ

### How does Balar ensure only one bulk call is made?

Balar automatically batches function calls across all executions of the `balar.run()` handler. Even if you call `getBooks()` multiple times from the wrapper, Balar will only perform **one bulk call to `getBooks()`** under the hood. It does this by leveraging deferred promises and the `AsyncLocalStorage` API to track execution context.

### Which signatures are accepted for bulk functions?

At this time, you can only provide the following signature:

```ts
type BulkFn<In, Out, Args extends readonly unknown[]> = (
  request: In[],
  ...args: Args
) => Promise<Map<In, Out>>;
```

This is because it's the simplest signature for which it's possible to derive a single-item overload (returning an array of `Out` would be ambiguous: how to link output to input if the output array is not the same length as the input array at runtime?).

### How to handle errors?

Balar never catches any errors thrown from within a `balar.run()` processor function, making the whole operation fail if any execution throws. The recommended way to handle errors is to have them represented in your return type. 

Reason: it's not possible to encode the type provided to `reject` into the `Promise` type, and it feels wrong for the library to constrain processor function types to return `Promise<T | Error>` instead of leaving control to the developer over how errors should look like.

### Can I use Balar-wrapped functions as drop-in replacements for the original functions?

No. At this time, using a Balar-wrapped function or object outside of a `balar.run()` execution context will result in an exception being thrown. While it forces consumers into creating a `balar` execution context for any code using wrappers, it also makes said code more predictable because you don't have to ask yourself whether it will synchronize/batch or not (it always will).

### What if I run nested `balar.run()` calls ?

Balar will automatically understand how to handle operations within nested `balar.run()` calls.

```ts
await balar.run([1, 2], async (n) => {
  await balar.run([n, n + 10], async () => {
    // Will wait to collect all 4 inputs ([1, 11, 2, 12]) before executing
    // the underlying bulk operation
    await wrapper.bulkOp(n);
  });
});
```

---

## Non-Goals (Everything Else)

By design, Balar concerns itself with only 3 things: gathering inputs for bulk operations, executing them, and being transparent about how it does it. With how ‚Äúintrusive‚Äù the abstractions of this library are, I wouldn't want you to have to trust it with more than strictly necessary. Any other feature (caching, timeouts, retries‚Ä¶) are out of scope and can be handled by other means in your application code instead. Balar only provides an alternative way to write bulk processing code.
